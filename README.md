# Muscle-isometric-force-model-Towards-control-design
Muscle Functioning Modeling: After a deep study of the most relevant models, it has been chosen to develop two prototypes. The first one, called Evaluation model, was developed to understand better the phenomena of muscle force production in Isometric conditions; This prototype is designed to emulate muscle response in a simplified way, neglecting effects such as yielding, and fiber recruitment. The second model, defined as Control model, has been developed as a linear product of two nonlinear components. The particular structure of the Control model was conceived to use this prototype for the design of the controller through particular control techniques that require a linear and simple model.
